Customer relationship management is abbreviated as CRM 
It is an approach which helps business in improving customer relationships and also to get new customers 
More customer satisfaction more the improvement in business and vice versa. Therefore to grow a business CRM plays an important role.
For this the business needs a CRM software where it can store the data, keep  track of sales etc.
This can be done by maintaining spreadsheets too but rather than spennding much time on data entry, the time can be spent on improving customer relationship.
CRM integrations with chat (chatbot), phone, email etc are playing and important role in collecting and recording the customer information.
For example if I go to a shopping website and enter details about what kind of things i am searching for and my personal details all the details are recorded and when the things which i want are available I get mails or messages or notifications that a particular item is available.
And this can avoid me from checking the website always for the material.
